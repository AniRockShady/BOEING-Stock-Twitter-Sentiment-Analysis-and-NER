# Sentiment Analysis and NER on Boeing Stock Related Tweets
 This Project is based on the efforts to Analyze the twitter sentiments on Boeing over time and also analyse the entities that are related/mentioned in the tweets.
 The sentiment analysis was conducted on the prepared data using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) scoring technique. The pre-trained SentimentIntensityAnalyzer class from the Natural Language Toolkit nlkt.sentiment was used for this analysis. The scoring technique is used to evaluate the tweets and assign the corresponding sores to the adjacent column (“compound_sentiment_score”).
Three word clouds are prepared for analysis from the positive (score > 00.5), negative (score < 0.05) and neutral (-0.05 > score < 0.05) scored tweets to check the most frequent words leading to these sentiment. Another important aspect i.e. Temporal Sentiment Analysis was taken into account and is plotted to check the valuable insights on how the sentiment changes over different time periods and that can be used to observe trends, patterns, or specific events that influence sentiment. Finally the tweets with highest and lowest scores are checked.
